# BooksToScrape_ETL

**BooksToScrape_ETL** is an end-to-end data project that extracts data from the [Books to Scrape](http://books.toscrape.com/) website, transforms and cleans the data, stores it in a MySQL database, and visualizes key insights using Python. This project demonstrates an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline along with data cleaning, analysis, and visualization techniques.

## Overview

This project was developed as a final project for a data sprint course. It involves:

- **Scraping**: Extracting book details (title, price, rating, and product link) from all pages of the Books to Scrape website.
- **Database Insertion**: Storing the scraped data in a MySQL database after proper transformation.
- **Data Cleaning and Analysis**: Loading the scraped data, converting data types, handling missing values, creating calculated columns (e.g., price categories), and normalizing categorical data.
- **Visualization**: Creating visual representations (bar charts, histograms, boxplots) using Seaborn and Matplotlib for better insights.

## Features

- **ETL Pipeline**: Automated scraping from the Books to Scrape website.
- **MySQL Integration**: Inserts data into a MySQL database with proper Unicode support.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handles type conversion, missing values, normalization, and adds calculated columns.
- **Data Visualization**: Generates high-resolution (300 dpi) visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
- **Modular Code Structure**: Each step of the pipeline is encapsulated in its own script.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/BooksToScrape_ETL.git
   cd BooksToScrape_ETL
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   *(Ensure your `requirements.txt` includes all necessary libraries.)*

## Usage

### Scraping and Database Insertion

- **Script:** `scraping.py`
- **Description:** This script scrapes book data from the Books to Scrape website, saves the data in CSV, JSON, and Excel formats into the **output** folder, and inserts the data into a MySQL database.
- **Run the script:**

  ```bash
  python scraping.py
  ```

### Data Cleaning and Analysis

- **Script:** `data_cleaning_analysis.py`
- **Description:** This script loads the raw CSV (from **output/books.csv**), cleans and analyzes the data (conversion, missing values, normalization, and calculated columns), and saves the cleaned data as **books_clean.csv** in the **output** folder.
- **Run the script:**

  ```bash
  python data_cleaning_analysis.py
  ```

### Data Visualization

- **Script:** `data_visualization.py`
- **Description:** This script loads the cleaned data from **output/books_clean.csv** and generates several visualizations (rating distribution, price category distribution, price histogram, boxplot of prices by rating). The visualizations are saved in the **images** folder with high resolution (300 dpi).
- **Run the script:**

  ```bash
  python data_visualization.py
  ```

## Database Setup

- **SQL Script:** `database.sql`
- **Description:** Use this script in MySQL Workbench or your preferred MySQL client to create the database and table structure required for the project. It sets up the `books_scrape` database and a `books` table with proper Unicode settings.
